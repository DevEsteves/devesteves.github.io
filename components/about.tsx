                    Hi there! I&apos;m a passionate Software Developer who enjoys solving problems with technology. 
                    I hold a degree in Systems Analysis and Development from Unopar, and I&apos;m always looking for ways 
                    to create innovative solutions that can make lives easier. As part of my ongoing professional development,
                    I&apos;m also studying best practices for writing clean, readable code. 
                    I believe that well-written code is not only more efficient, but also more enjoyable to work with in the long run.
